# Pewlett Hackard Retirement Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of the Pewlett Hackard Retirement Analysis was to convert existing csv files containing employee information into a database system allowing for analysis to determine how many employees are eligible for retirement, in what department they currently work, what their current titles are, and if they are qualified for a possible mentorship program within the company.

## Results

After the analysis was completed, four points are of note:

- There are 29,414 senior engineers who qualify for retirement
- There are 28,254 senior staff employees who qualify for retirement
- 1,549 employees could act as mentors for the next generation of Pewlett Hackard leaders
- There are 2 active managers whom qualify for retirement and earlier analysis shows this is roughly half of all managers.

## Summary

Taking into account all of the employees who qualify for retirement at the point of this analysis, the impending wave of retirements will leave 90,398 positions that will need to be filled at Pewlett Hackard. The numbers also reveal that there are no where near enough employees available to mentor those who will come after them. The data shows that the ratio of mentors-to-positions is 1,549-to-90,398. There will need to be an alternative structure implimented for the education of the next generation of employees.

* Since it will be difficult to address the lack of mentors available, it maybe benifical to approach manager is the **'manager_key_points'** list to ask if they can help develop some material to guide the employees who will fill roles open by retirement within their departments.
